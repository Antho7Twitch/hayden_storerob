# What is this Script?
I've seen some very outdated, exploitable store robberies out there, so I've decided to take an initiative and release something that I feel is simplistic and suits all ESX servers.
# Requirements
This resource has ONLY been tested on ESX Legacy (update btw), and has been untested elsewhere
# How to setup?
You can set this resource up by simply downloading, and dragging and dropping into your server (then obviously starting it).
# Support
I offer some limited support via my discord server: https://discord.gg/gKKfSx3s2V
