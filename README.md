# Haydenâ€™s Simple Store Robbery System
## What is this Script?

This is an unexploitable, up-to-date store robbery system created for ESX Legacy, it supports complete config changes & is localised to allow for other languages.
If you find ANY exploits within the script, please directly contact me via my discord - this is my first release on FiveM, and I'm still not 100% with LUA.

## Requirements

- [es_extended](https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended/tree/legacy) (Legacy)
- [mythic_notify](https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify.git)
- [pd-safe](https://github.com/VHall1/pd-safe.git)

## How to setup?

You can set this resource up by simply downloading, and dragging and dropping into your server (then obviously starting it).

## Features
Choose between robbing the Clerk or the safe. Exploit checking & Cop notifications included.

Optimised and ready for a public server - networked & synced between players

## Upcoming Features

- Nothing Planned

## Support

I offer some limited support via my discord server: https://discord.gg/gKKfSx3s2V
