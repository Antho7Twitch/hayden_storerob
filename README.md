# IN DEVELOPMENT - SHOULD NOT BE USED
# What is this Script?
This is an unexploitable, up-to-date store robbery system created for ESX Legacy, it supports complete config changes & is localised to allow for other languages.
If you find ANY exploits within the script, please directly contact me via my discord - this is my first release on FiveM, and I'm still not 100% with LUA.
# Requirements
This resource has ONLY been tested on ESX Legacy (update btw), and has been untested elsewhere
# How to setup?
You can set this resource up by simply downloading, and dragging and dropping into your server (then obviously starting it).
# Support
I offer some limited support via my discord server: https://discord.gg/gKKfSx3s2V
