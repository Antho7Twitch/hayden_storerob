# What is this Script?
This is an unexploitable, up-to-date store robbery system created for ESX Legacy, it supports complete config changes & is localised to allow for other languages.
If you find ANY exploits within the script, please directly contact me via my discord - this is my first release on FiveM, and I'm still not 100% with LUA.
# Requirements
- ESX Legacy
- Mythic Notify
# How to setup?
You can set this resource up by simply downloading, and dragging and dropping into your server (then obviously starting it).
# Upcomding Features (Maybe)
- Qtarget/bt-target support
- Vault with minigame to rob
# Support
I offer some limited support via my discord server: https://discord.gg/gKKfSx3s2V
